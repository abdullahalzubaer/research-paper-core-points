Some core points that I thought worth remembering when skimming through a paper (Pass 1 mainly; which includes Abstract, intro and conclusion) 

### GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models 
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229)
  - We found that while LLMs exhibit some robustness to changes in proper names, they are more sensitive to variations in numerical values
  - [llms] sophisticated pattern matching more than true logical reasoning
