Some core points that I thought worth remembering when skimming through a paper (Pass 1 mainly; which includes Abstract, intro and conclusion) 

### GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models 
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229)
  - We found that while LLMs exhibit some robustness to changes in proper names, they are more sensitive to variations in numerical values
  - [llms] sophisticated pattern matching more than true logical reasoning

### TO COT OR NOT TO COT? CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT HELPS MAINLY ON MATH AND SYMBOLIC REASONING
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12183)
  - CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks.
  - In areas beyond math, results show that CoT is not as useful (Kambhampati et al., 2024a) or can even hurt performance (Wang et al., 2024)
  - CoT only helps substantially on problems requiring mathematical, logical, or algorithmic reasoning.
